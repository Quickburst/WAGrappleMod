  More like Opti<strong>Bad</strong></p></details>
This is an attempted port to 1.17.1 (Does not work currently)
Java version, mappings and all details updated. Just needs a few more additions which I don't understand.

TODO:
* rope recalculating it's position when blocks destroyed
* make it work better in multiplayer
* bug fixes
* dungeon block (this will be a better default ungrapplable block)
